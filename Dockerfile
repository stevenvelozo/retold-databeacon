# `npm install`, not `npm ci` — this ecosystem's Quackage convention
# is to gitignore package-lock.json, so `ci` (which requires the
# lockfile in the build context) cannot work in CI. The tradeoff is
# that builds resolve dep ranges fresh each time rather than from a
# pinned tree; acceptable for retold modules where the upstream
# ranges are owned by the same author.
